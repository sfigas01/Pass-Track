# Pass-Track
A beautiful, simple web app to track fitness class passes, monitor spending, and visualize usage patterns.

This app was created in a few hours using Claude (not Claude Code) to learn more about vibe coding with Claude without development knowledge.
It does not yet have a database, but does work with the session memory. 

It's deployed using GitHub spaces. The memory does not persist and there is no support for multiple users profiles.
